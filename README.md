# Retail_store
On a retail website, the following discounts apply:
1. If the user is an employee of the store, he gets a 30% discount
2. If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount
3. If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount.
4. For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 990, you get $ 45
as a discount).
5. The percentage based discounts do not apply on groceries.
6. A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill.
Write a program in a programming language of your choice with test cases such that given a
bill, it finds the net payable amount. Please note the stress is on object oriented approach
and test coverage. User interface is not required. What we care about:
• object oriented programming approach, provide a high level UML class diagram of all
the key classes in your solution. This can either be on paper or using a CASE tool
• unit test and code coverage
• code to be generic and simple
• leverage today's best coding practices
• clear README.md that explains how the code and the test can be run and how the
coverage reports can be generated
